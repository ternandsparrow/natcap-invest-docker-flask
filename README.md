HTTP wrapper around [NatCap's InVEST](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/natcap.invest) using Flask.

Specifically we've focused on the pollination model at this stage, because that's what we need.

Getting an idea of the performance and required resources is useful. We'll run the Docker container on my
laptop with a 2nd gen Core i7, plenty of RAM and using a secondary SSD. We're using the out-of-the-box demo
farm vector and the default farm padding of 3km which gives us a raster size of approximately 13x12 km. We see
the following figures:

years simulated | run times for 3 runs (seconds) | disk used
--- | --- | ---
1 | 2.5-2.6 | 125MB
3 | 3.5-3.6 | 249MB
10 | 7.4-8.0 | 683MB
30 | 20.2-20.7 | 1.9GB

All years are run in parallel with one process per year so the CPUs are completely used once the number of
years equals the number of cores (8 on my machine). Even though the NatCap model writes a lot of intermediate
`tif` files as part of the processing, a faster disk (like ramdisk) doesn't improve performance because we're
CPU-bound. Also note that all the files produced from InVEST are removed after a run, however you *need* the
disk space available to perform the run.

## Version numbers
We tag the Git and DockerHub repos with a version scheme: `{our version}_{InVEST version}`, for example
`1.1.1_3.6.0`.

## Running it

This is a docker image and it's built on DockerHub, so to run on a host all you need is to grab the runner script from
this repo (you don't need to whole repo) and a host with docker installed. It will pull the image when you run the
script.

  1. get the runner script
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/ternandsparrow/natcap-invest-docker-flask
      cd natcap-invest-docker-flask
      cp run-container.sh.example run-container.sh
      # OR, pull direct from GitHub
      curl -L https://github.com/ternandsparrow/natcap-invest-docker-flask/raw/master/run-container.sh.example > run-container.sh
      ```
  1. make it executable
      ```bash
      chmod +x run-container.sh
      ```
  1. make any required edits
      ```bash
      vim run-container.sh # select an image tag and/or enable production mode
      ```
  1. run it
      ```bash
      ./run-container.sh
      ```

You can configure aspects of the model execution by providing [env
parameters](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables) to the `docker run` command.

| key |value type | default value | description |
| --- |---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
|`FARM_PADDING_METRES`|integer|3000| padding, in metres, used when cropping the raster around the farm vector. Smaller values mean faster runs but if you go too small, it'll negatively affect results as there's not enough raster around the farm to calculate wild pollination values. |
|`PURGE_WORKSPACE`|0 or 1|1 (True)|controls if the temporary workspace on disk is completely purged after each run. Each request is stateless/self-contained so the only reason to keep the workspace is for debugging reasons.|

Then you can use it like this:
```bash
curl localhost:5000/ # get available links, just a healthcheck really
# change to a dir where we can use the example payloads
cd natcap-invest-docker-flask/natcap_invest_docker_flask/static/
# execute the pollination model:
echo '{"crop_type":"apple","years":3,"farm":'`cat example-farm-vector.json`',"reveg":'`cat example-reveg-vector.json`'}' \
  | curl \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  -d @- \
  'http://localhost:5000/pollination'
```

Alternatively, you can go to http://localhost:5000/tester to use a web UI to interact with the service.

## Code style
We're using [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) to format the code in this
repo.


## Building it

You can build this project with the following command:
```bash
docker build -t ternandsparrow/natcap-invest-docker-flask:dev .
```

The docker build uses a multi-stage approach. This means subsequent builds will be fast because they'll use the build
cache. The last stage of the build, which always runs, copys the code over to the container. If you make changes to
the dependencies, you'll need to bust the cache and rebuild all stages. Do this with:
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t ternandsparrow/natcap-invest-docker-flask:dev .
```

## Affect of farm vector inputs on the outputs
There are quite a few parameters in the attribute table of the farm vector that you supply, as a user. To get
a feel for how they affect the output, have a look at
[spectrum/value_spectrum_0.33step.csv](./spectrum/value_spectrum_0.33step.csv). If you want to produce your
own spectrum file, see the `spectrum/value_spectrum.py` program.

## Faster development iterations

There are 4 ways to run this project:
 1. build the docker image and run it
 1. (preferred) use the built docker container but mount your workspace as a volume so it sees the changes *live* (the
    `LOCAL_DEV` env var will trigger the volume mounting)
      ```bash
      # edit your run-container.sh file that you created by following the instructions under "Running it"
      #  so the docker tag matches what you used to build the image
      LOCAL_DEV=1 ./run-container.sh
      ```
 1. have a virtualenv (or not, if you're crazy) with all the dependencies installed and run full implementations directly on your machine
 1. use `tests/stub_runner.py` (FIXME need to also install GDAL, natcap, etc which aren't explicit requirements -
    assumed to come from base Docker image)

The first three methods run a "real" system that will actually call natcap's code. The fourth method runs flask
with a stub natcap implementation behind it so you can quickly iterate on changes to the HTTP related code
without running the slow backend code or building a docker image (also slow).

## Running unit tests
The code base is currently only lightly tested and as such doesn't require all the dependencies to be able to run the
tests. This means you can run tests by:

  1. create a virtualenv
      ```bash
      virtualenv -p python3 .venv
      . .venv/bin/activate
      ```
  1. install the dependencies for this project (doesn't include the underlying dependencies like natcap and GDAL)
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt
      ```
  1. run the tests
      ```bash
      nose2
      ```

In the future when we test more of the code, and we need natcap, etc to be present, we'll probably run the tests inside
a docker container.

## Benchmarking
The NatCap InVEST software is CPU bound so more CPUs means fasters runs. To see
how a machine performs with varying lengths of simulation (years):

  1. start the server (serving at localhost:5000): `./run-container.sh`
  1. make sure you have the python requests library available: `pip install requests`
  1. run the benchmark script: `python tests/benchmark.py`
  1. the output will be a CSV (written to stdout) that you can chart as you like
